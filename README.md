## Titanic Survival Analysis – End-to-End Capstone Project

### Project Overview

This project presents a complete end-to-end data analysis of the Titanic dataset. The objective was to clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate meaningful visualizations, and extract actionable insights from passenger survival patterns.

### Project Workflow

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature engineering (e.g., FamilySize)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Survival trend visualization
- Insight generation and recommendations

### Key Visualizations

- Survival rate by gender
- Survival rate by passenger class
- Age distribution analysis

### Key Findings

- Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates, indicating demographic-based evacuation prioritization.
- First-class passengers showed higher survival probability, revealing socioeconomic disparities in access to safety resources.
- Younger passengers demonstrated slightly better survival distribution, suggesting age-related rescue prioritization.

### Business Recommendations

- Implement structured emergency prioritization frameworks.
- Ensure equal safety access across all passenger classes.
- Incorporate demographic segmentation into evacuation planning models.

### Project Deliverables

Reproducible Jupyter Notebook (code + markdown explanations)

Visual analysis and summary insights

### Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

This project was completed as part of the Syntecxhub Data Analytics Internship.
